# Connect to other nodes

*Note that this tutorial describes how to **configure** a node to connect to other peers before runnning the node.
For connecting a running node to existing peers,
see the [JSON-RPC guide](TODO)*

There are currently three options.
Note that each of these options can be used in combination with any of the other two.
In other words, it is possible to configure a node to connect
to a static list of peers and
to discover such peer lists using DNS discovery and
discover and connect to random peers using discovery v5 with a bootstrap node.
